# logonui-deleter
This application made with dev-c++ (C) will delete the logonui.exe file in the system directory. It does not use any built-in or third-party tools for windows. Only the win32 api. Best of all, it doesn't even need to take  ownership of the file :) 
To Open the project, extract the zip fike to anywhere you like, install dev-c++ via this link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/ , open the logondeleter.dev file from dev-c++ and enjoy :)
